    <string name="descripcion_calor_extremo">Extreme heat is defined as much higher summer temperatures or
        much more humid conditions than average. This extreme heat can cause heat stroke,
        which is a condition characterized by nausea, vomiting, headache, heat of the skin,
        drowsiness, and disruption of muscle fibers exposed to its effects.
        This is caused by the fact that the body does not have the capacity to cool
        itself adequately.\n
        <b>\nPrevention\n</b>
        <li>Identify places in your community where you can go to cool off, such as libraries or shopping centers.</li>\n
        <li>Cover windows with curtains or blinds.</li>\n
        <li>Insulate doors and windows.</li>\n
        <b>\nWhat to do\n</b>

        <li>Strong, rapid pulse.</li>\n
        <li>Dizziness, confusion, or loss of consciousness.</li>\n

    <string name="descripcion_incendio">A wildfire is a fire that spreads uncontrolled in forest or wild land, affecting plant fuels, flora and fauna. It is distinguished from other types of fire by its wide spread, the speed with which it can spread from its place of origin, its potential to change direction unexpectedly, and its ability to overcome obstacles such as roads, rivers, and firebreaks.\n
        <b>\nWhat to do\n</b>
        <li>Move away from the fire in the opposite direction of the smoke.</li>\n

        <li>Do not seek shelter in caves, farm huts, high ground or downwind of the fire.</li>\n
        <li>Remember that fire rises uphill.</li>\n
        <li>Do not use a vehicle if you are surrounded by fire.</li>\n
        <li>In case of fire, try to flee by the flanks, looking for an area devoid of vegetation.</li>\n
        <li>If there is no other way out, wet your clothes, protect your face and cross where the front is narrow or of low intensity.</li>\n
        <li>In the event of clothing catching on fire, do not run. Roll on the ground or cover yourself with a blanket.</li>\n

    </string>

    <string name="descripcion_avalancha">An avalanche is a huge amount of snow that slides rapidly down the mountain, usually on slopes of 30 to 45 degrees. When an avalanche stops, the snow solidifies like concrete and people become trapped. People trapped in avalanches can die from suffocation, trauma or hypothermia.\n

    <string name="descripcion_lluvia_acida">Acid rain is one of the consequences of atmospheric pollution. It is precipitation containing both water and toxic residues, mainly acidic, from industrial emissions and other types of machinery, such as vehicles. This acidification of soil and surface water has devastating effects on ecosystems and poses a serious danger to living beings.\n
        <b>\nPrevention\n</b>
        <li>Filter and detoxify the water used by factories before returning it to rivers.</li>\n
        <li>Reduce the emission of polluting gases by industry.</li>\n
        <li>To favor the production and use of clean energies, to the detriment of fossil fuels.</li>\n
        <li>Reduce energy consumption in factories and companies.</li>\n
        <li>Plant trees to absorb polluted air.</li>\n
        <li>Raise awareness of the importance of reducing energy consumption in homes.</li>\n
        <li>Encourage the use of electric cars and other non-polluting vehicles, such as bicycles.</li>\n
    </string>

    <string name="descripcion_erupcion_volcanica">A volcano is an opening in the earth\'s crust
        that allows molten rock, gases and debris to escape to the surface.
        A volcanic eruption can involve lava and debris that can move at speeds
        of up to 100 mph, destroying everything in its path. Volcanic ash can
        travel for hundreds of miles and cause serious health problems.\n
        <b>\nPrevention\n</b>
        <li>Know the risk of a volcanic eruption in your area.</li>\n
        <li>Learn about community warning systems.</li>\n
        <li>Get necessary supplies ahead of time in case you have to evacuate immediately or in case of utility outages. Be aware of each person\'s specific needs, including medications. Don\'t forget the needs of pets.</li>\n
        <li>Consult with your physician if you have pre-existing respiratory difficulties.</li>\n
        <li>Practice a communication and evacuation plan with all members of your family.</li>\n
        <li>Have a shelter plan if ash is the greatest risk.</li>\n
        <li>Find out about your homeowner\'s insurance policy coverage for volcanic eruptions.</li>\n
        <b>\nWhat to do\n</b>
        <li>Be alert to warnings.</li>\n
        <li>Follow evacuation orders from local authorities. Evacuate early.</li>\n
        <li>Avoid areas downwind, and valleys downstream, from the volcano. Debris and ash will be carried by the wind and fall by gravity.</li>\n
        <li>If you have sufficient supplies, temporarily protect yourself from volcanic ash where you are. Cover air vents and seal doors and windows.</li>\n
        <li>If you are outdoors, protect yourself from falling ash that can irritate skin and damage respiratory tract, eyes and open wounds. Wear a certified, well-fitting respirator, such as an N95.</li>\n
        <li>Avoid driving while heavy ash is falling. If you must drive, then turn off your vehicle lights.</li>\n

    <string name="descripcion_gota_fria">According to the State Meteorological Agency, a cold drop or DANA (Isolated High Level Depression) is a large mass of low temperature air that has separated from a polar jet. This, being in areas of warmer weather, interacts with the air of higher temperature in the area and causes storms of all kinds and meteorological instability, and can cause, among other things, winds of up to 100 km / h. It is more common in coastal areas near warm waters, since the moisture-laden air rising from these warm seas favors the formation of these cold drops when it meets the polar jets.\n
        <b>\nPrevention\n</b>
        <li>Avoid leaving your belongings on the porch, as they can be swept away by heavy rains, wind or floods and cause accidents.</li>\n
        <li>Do not leave your flower pots or any other object that could fall into the street from the window and cause an accident. Secure windows well to avoid damage to the interior.</li>\n
        <li>Stay away from places where you are alone or where there are trees nearby. It is advisable to return home or seek shelter if you are far away.</li>\n
        <b>\nWhat to do\n</b>
        <li>Be informed of weather forecasts.</li>\n
        <li>In case of flooding, locate the highest points and/or settle in a place that is not susceptible to flooding.</li>\n
        <li>Stay away from ravines, torrents and their bridges.</li>\n
        <li>Do not cross flooded sections, the force of the current can drag you. In the event that you find yourself in one with your car, the most important thing is to abandon the car and look for higher ground.</li>\n
    </string>

    <string name="descripcion_tormenta_electrica">Lightning is one of the leading causes of injury and death from weather hazards. Although most lightning victims survive, people struck by lightning often manifest a number of long-term debilitating symptoms. Thunderstorms are dangerous storms that include lightning and can create or cause powerful winds in excess of 50 mph (80 km/h), hail, flash flooding and/or tornadoes.\n
        <b>\nPrevention\n</b>
        <li>Know the risk of thunderstorms in your area.</li>\n
        <li>Reinforce your home: cut down trees that could fall on it, consider purchasing surge protectors or a lightning rod.</li>\n
        <li>Make an emergency plan and identify resistant buildings near where you live, work or study.</li>\n
        <b>\nWhat to do\n</b>
        <li>If you hear thunder, take shelter indoors. If you are outdoors, go inside a building or car with a roof.</li>\n
        <li>Pay attention to alerts and warnings.</li>\n
        <li>Avoid using electronic devices plugged into an electrical outlet.</li>\n
        <li>Avoid tap water.</li>\n
        <li>Do not drive on flooded streets and roads. It only takes six inches of rushing water to knock a person down, and a foot of moving water can sweep away a vehicle.</li>\n
